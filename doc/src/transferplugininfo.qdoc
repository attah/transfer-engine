    \class SharingPluginInfo
    \brief The SharingPluginInfo class is an abstract class encapsulates information about share plugin.

    \ingroup transfer-engine-lib

    SharingPluginInfo provides information about single share plugin via SharingMethodInfo
    class. Because one plugin can support multiple accounts e.g. user can have one, two or
    more Facebook accounts, this class provides a list of SharingMethodInfo object instances.
*/

/*!
    \fn virtual QList<SharingMethodInfo> SharingPluginInfo::info() const = 0

    Subclass must implement this method and provide at least one SharingMethodInfo
    object instance. If a plugin supports multiple accounts e.g. more than one Facebook
    account, then list must contain one TransferMethodEntry per enabled account.

    Returns a list of SharingMethodInfo objects.
*/

/*!
    \fn virtual void SharingPluginInfo::query() = 0

    Subclass must implement this method and make sure that when info is available
    infoReady() signal will be emitted. If SharingMethodInfo data is ready, calling this
    method should just emit infoReady() signal.
*/

/*!
    \fn void TransferPluginInfo::infoReady()

    Subclass must emit this signal when info() method is ready to return
    a list of SharingMethodInfo data.
*/

/*!
    \fn void TransferPluginInfo::infoError(const QString &msg)

    Subclass must emit this signal with an error \a msg if there's an error i.e. info() method
    can't return a list of SharingMethodInfo objects.
*/
