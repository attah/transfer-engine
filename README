Nemo Transfer Engine
--------------------

Nemo Transfer Engine is an engine for sharing content and keeping track of sync, download and uploads.  
This engine doesn't provide any UI specific components, but instead it makes possible to build e.g.  
Transfer UI for displaying all the transfers (finished, failed, canceled or in progress) by using the  
API it defines.  

To create share plugins, Nemo Transfer Engine defines required interfaces, which each plugin must  
implement.  

For more details about API and implementing share plugins, generate docs according to instructions below.
