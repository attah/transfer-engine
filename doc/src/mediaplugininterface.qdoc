    \class TransferPluginInterface
    \brief The TransferPluginInterface class defines an abstract interface for each TransferEngine share plugins to implement.

    \ingroup transfer-engine-lib

    TransferEngine supports C++ share plugins. Each share plugin must implement couple of well defined interfaces:

    \list
        \li \l TransferPluginInterface Provides interfaces to access required objects to start sharing.
        \li \l MediaTransferInterface  Implements the actual sharing functionality
        \li \l TransferPluginInfo      Provides information about plugin status such as is it ready.
    \endlist

    TransferPluginInterface provides information to the TransferEngine via this interface.
*/

/*!
   \fn MediaTransferInterface * TransferPluginInterface::transferObject() = 0

   Return MediaTransferInterface object
 */

/*!
   \fn virtual TransferPluginInfo *TransferPluginInterface::infoObject() = 0

   Return TransferPluginInfo object
 */

/*!
   \fn virtual QString TransferPluginInterface::pluginId() const = 0

   Return a plugin id e.g. Facebook, Twitter, etc.
 */

/*!
   \fn virtual bool TransferPluginInterface::enabled() const = 0

   Return true or false depending if the plugin is enabled or not
